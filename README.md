## Abstract
Extracting cell–cell relations from biomedical literature is essential for understanding intercellular communication in immunity, inflammation, and tissue biology. However, cell–cell relation extraction has not been established as a standalone biomedical relation extraction task, and no benchmark corpus or systematic evaluation framework currently exists. Fully manual corpus construction is costly and difficult to scale, limiting literature-based analyses of cell–cell communication.

In this work, we define a sentence-level cell–cell relation extraction task and construct complementary manually annotated corpora under realistic annotation constraints. Rule-based literature mining is used solely as an **annotation accelerator** to identify candidate sentences, while all relation labels are assigned manually. In addition, an independently annotated PubMed corpus without rule-based filtering is constructed to evaluate robustness on naturally occurring sentence distributions. Using these resources, we systematically evaluate representative model configurations involving entity indication strategies, classification architectures, and continued pre-training.

Our results show that cell–cell relation extraction remains challenging under realistic conditions. While increasing training data size and combining entity-aware architectures with continued pre-training yield modest robustness improvements, performance on unfiltered PubMed sentences remains in the 70% accuracy range. Comparisons with general-purpose large language models further suggest that task complexity, rather than model class, is the primary limiting factor.

This repository provides the datasets, model implementations, and evaluation code used in our study, serving as a practical foundation for future work on literature-scale cell–cell relation extraction.
